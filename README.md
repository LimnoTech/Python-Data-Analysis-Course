# Python Data Analysis Course
April 23-24, 2018

Syllabus and notes for LimnoTech's Python Data Analysis 3-hour course

## Before the Course (should take 30 minutes - 1 hour)

**Install the Python Anaconda distribution on your computer.** Use the instructions here

We will go over Python basics in the course, but if you can spend some time familiarizing yourself before the course, we can get to the interesting stuff faster.

**Visit http://www.learnpython.org and go through the Learn the Basics section.** The "Classes and Objects" and "Modules and Packages" are extra credit and not as important as the other sections. You can try out code right in the browser and do not need any other software. In Python, you can write code in a file that you can reuse (a "script") or you can write it in a shell to get results immediately. This website shows you both. If you want to keep going, feel free!
