Data Analysis Landscape

### Setting Expectations

- We have 3 hours
- I am not an expert
- Learning and retaining requires additional work

### Who are we?

---

Half have some Python experience

Half have at least heard of Anaconda

---

### My Goals
- Give you the tools you need to fearlessly decide to use Python, **if appropriate**, and get started on a project.
- Show you where to look (or who to ask) for more information.
- Make sure the tool we choose isn't limiting our ability.
- Keep the community going after this course.
